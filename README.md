# dadata_suggestions

Yet another Dadata Address Suggestions library.
It is a Dart rewrite of my [iOS library](https://github.com/illabo/IIDadata) and [Android library](https://github.com/illabo/DadataSuggestions). 
It is primarily intended to be used as a geocoder (forward and reverse) for addresses within Russia.

## Motivation

There were no cross-platform Dadata library for Flutter.
